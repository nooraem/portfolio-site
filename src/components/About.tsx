                Soon to be graduated, and eager to improve my skills on any occasion.

            <p>
                Besides software development, I have a passion for graphic design and all things visual. 
                I have designed logos, advertisements and websites for both companies and private individuals.
                I often spend my free time to improve my skills with personal projects.
                However, I like to relax by enjoying a game or two every now and then.
